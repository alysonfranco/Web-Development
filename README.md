# Web-Development
This is where I will upload the projects I work on as I progress through my web development journey. I took an Internet Applications (CGS 3175) course in the fall of 2022; I learned HTML, CSS and a bit of Javascript and PHP. I would say that I am proficient in HTML and CSS and a beginner in Javascript and PHP. I also took a Database Concepts (2545) course in the fall of 2022. I hope to combine my web delvelopment and database management skills as I work on my Information Technology degree at the University of Central Florida.

gardenhose.html and greenthumb.html contain the first two projects I worked on in my internet applications class. I hope to combine the different aspects of both projects into a blog about my gardening and plant journey. While they may be a bit unorganized, it was my first time trying front end development. I am proud of what I was able to accomplish during the semster. I only hope to keep on improving from here.

greenthumb.html was the first project I worked on in my Internet Applications class, based off my favorite hobby. Working with html wasn't too difficult for me, however, the intoduction of CSS and Flexbox was a big learning curve. I am proud of what I accomplished my first time working with CSS.

gardenhose.html was the second and final project I worked on in my Intenet Applications class; the assignment was to create a responsive retail website with six webpages. After workign on my first project, there were many improvements I wanted to make on my approach to CSS for this project and assuring it was responsive added another challenge. I knew that I wanted the website to have a gardening theme but it took me a while to come up with the name, which usually helps me unravel the rest of the theme as creating the logo gives me the foundation I will use for the color scheme. With the help of my brother, shopping at Home Depot, and some friends,  I gathered inspiration that lead to the final product. I did attempt to create a working shopping cart with JavaScript, however, programming isn't really my strong suit so I put that mini project on pause. I hope to find resources to help me learn JavaScript and grow my knowledge of Full-Stack Web Development.

These projects, along with preparing my garden for the spring, have inspired me to create a blog/store for my gardening and houseplant journey. Plants have really helped me cope with my anxietied and stress; I want to share my experiences and tips, and give others a space to do the same. I want to make it easier for beginners to find the information and resources they need to start their journey. While I understand that developing this idea is a lengthy process, I will take it one step at a time as I am still working towards my major.
