# Web-Development
This is where I will upload the projects I work on as I progress through my web development journey. 
I took an Internet Applications (CGS 3175) course in the fall of 2022 and I learn HTML and CSS along wiht some Javascript and PHP. I would say that I am proficient in HTML and CSS and a beginner in Javascript and PHP. I also took a Database Concepts (2545) course  in the fall of 2022 and I hope to combine my skills in both web delvelopment and database management as I work on my Information Technology degree at the University of Central Florida.

index.html contains the first two projects I worked on in my internet applications class and I hope to combine the different aspects of both projects into a blog about my gardening and plant journey.
