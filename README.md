# Web-Development
This is where I will upload the projects I work on as I progress through my web development journey.

**_gardenhose.html_** and **_greenthumb.html_** contain the first two projects I worked on in my Internet Applications class. I hope to combine the different aspects of both projects into a blog about my gardening and plant journey. While they may be a bit disorganized, it was my first time trying front-end development. I am proud of what I was able to accomplish during the semester. I only hope to keep on improving from here.

**_greenthumb.html_** was the first project I worked on in my Internet Applications class, based on my favorite hobby. Working with HTML wasn't too difficult for me; however, the introduction of CSS and Flexbox was a steep learning curve. I am proud of what I accomplished during my first time working with CSS.

**_gardenhose.html_** was the second and final project I worked on in my Internet Applications class. The assignment was to create a responsive retail website with six webpages. After working on my first project, there were many improvements I wanted to make in my approach to CSS for this project, and assuring it was responsive added another challenge. I knew that I wanted the website to have a gardening theme, but it took me a while to come up with the name, which usually helps me unravel the rest of the theme, as creating the logo gives me the foundation I will use for the color scheme. With the help of my brother, shopping at Home Depot, and some friends, I gathered inspiration that led to the final product. I did attempt to create a working shopping cart with JavaScript; however, programming isn't really my strong suit, so I put that mini-project on pause. I hope to find resources to help me learn JavaScript and grow my knowledge of Full-Stack Web Development.

As I began working on expanding my web development skills, I took on a personal summer project that ended up taking a lot longer than I expected. Nonetheless, I will continue to work on this project and hope to complete and publish the first iteration of my website by January 1st, 2024.
